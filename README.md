# Final Project - Group 22

This project analyzes the dataset, which was curated from an office building constructed in 2015 in Berkeley, California, which includes whole-building and end-use energy consumption, HVAC system operating conditions, indoor and outdoor environmental parameters, and occupant counts. This dataset was used for various types of applications, including building energy benchmarking, load shape analysis, energy prediction, occupancy prediction and analytics, and HVAC controls to improve understanding and efficiency of building operations for reducing energy use, energy costs, and carbon emissions.

In our analysis, we will be exploring how the energy consumption of the building is influenced by various factors.
